# dohd

Dohd (pron. doh-dee) is a minimalist DNS-over-HTTPS daemon that redirects all DoH queries
to a local DNS server running on localhost:53 (UDP).

## Features

- Partial support for RFC8484 DNS-over-HTTPS (POST method only for now)
- Record freshness derived from minimum TTL among answers

## Building

1. Ensure that  [wolfSSL](https://github.com/wolfssl/wolfssl) is installed on your system, and
configured to support TLS 1.3 (configure option: --enable-tls13).

2. Type `make`.

## Usage

dohd -c *certificate* -k *private-key* \[-p *port*\] \[-F\] \[-u *user*\]

### Command line parameters:

- '-c *certificate*' - specifies which certificate for the TLS server. (Mandatory parameter)
- '-k *private-key*' - specifies the private key used by the TLS server. (Mandatory parameter)
- '-p *port*' - changes the listening port for the DoH service (default:8053)
- '-u *user*' - drop root privileges after binding to the TCP port by switching user (mandatory when running as root)
- '-F' - runs dohd in foreground (instead of creating a daemon)

### Browser configuration

- In Firefox, go to 'about:preferences' -> Network Settings -> Settings
- check 'Enable DNS over HTTPS'
- Enable 'custom' option
- specify the URL of your DoH server
